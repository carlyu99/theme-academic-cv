abstract: 'Prediction markets are powerful tools to elicit and aggregate beliefs from
  strategic agents. However, in current prediction markets, agents may exhaust the
  social welfare by competing to be the first to update the market. We initiate the
  study of the trade-off between how quickly information is aggregated by the market,
  and how much this information costs. We design markets to aggregate timely information
  from strategic agents to maximize social welfare. To this end, the market must incentivize
  agents to invest the correct amount of effort to acquire information: quickly enough
  to be useful, but not faster (and more expensively) than necessary. The market also
  must ensure that agents report their information truthfully and on time. We consider
  two settings: in the first, information is only valuable before a deadline; in the
  second, the value of information decreases as time passes. We use both theorems
  and simulations to demonstrate the mechanisms.'
