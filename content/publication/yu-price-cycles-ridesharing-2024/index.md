abstract: In ridesharing platforms such as Uber and Lyft, it is observed that drivers
  sometimes collaboratively go offline when the price is low, and then return after
  the price has risen due to the perceived lack of supply. This collective strategy
  leads to cyclic fluctuations in prices and available drivers, resulting in poor
  reliability and social welfare. We study a continuous-time, non-atomic model and
  prove that such online/offline strategies may form a Nash equilibrium among drivers,
  but lead to a lower total driver payoff if the market is sufficiently dense. Furthermore,
  we show how to set price floors that effectively mitigate the emergence and impact
  of price cycles.
