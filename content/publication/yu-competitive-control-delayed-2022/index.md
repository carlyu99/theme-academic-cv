abstract: This paper studies the impact of imperfect information in online control
  with adversarial disturbances. In particular, we consider both delayed state feedback
  and inexact predictions of future disturbances. We introduce a greedy, myopic policy
  that yields a constant competitive ratio against the offline optimal policy. We
  also analyze the fundamental limits of online control with limited information by
  showing that our competitive ratio bounds for the greedy, myopic policy in the adversarial
  setting match (up to lower-order terms) lower bounds in the stochastic setting.
